# Collaboration

The Concept Mapping Tool provides real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same map simultaneously.

## Real-time Synchronization

All changes are synchronized instantly across all connected users:

- Concept creation and editing
- Relationship creation and editing
- Position changes
- Notes and metadata updates

## Presence Indicators

When other users are viewing or editing a map, you'll see:

- **Avatars**: Small avatars showing who is currently viewing the map
- **Cursors**: Live cursors showing where collaborators are working
- **Editing Highlights**: Visual indicators showing which elements are being edited

## Collaborative Editing

Multiple users can edit simultaneously:

- Different concepts can be edited by different users
- Changes are merged automatically
- Conflicts are resolved using last-write-wins semantics

## Best Practices

- **Communicate**: Use notes or external chat to coordinate
- **Avoid Conflicts**: If editing the same concept, coordinate edits
- **Save Regularly**: While auto-save is enabled, be mindful of your work
- **Use Perspectives**: Create perspectives for focused collaborative sessions

## Sharing

To collaborate, you need to share the map with other users. See the [Sharing Guide](/docs/user-guide/sharing) for details.
