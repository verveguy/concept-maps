# Comments

Comments are sticky note-style annotations that you can add to your concept maps to provide context, notes, or explanations. They appear as yellow sticky notes on the canvas and can be linked to one or more concepts.

## Creating Comments

### In Graph View

#### Method 1: Right-Click Context Menu
1. **Right-click** anywhere on the canvas background
2. Select **"Add Comment"** from the context menu
3. A new comment will appear at the click location
4. **Double-click** the comment to start editing

## Editing Comments

### Inline Editing
- **Double-click** on a comment node to edit its text inline
- Comments support **Markdown formatting** for rich text
- Press **Enter** or click outside to save changes
- Press **Escape** to cancel editing

### Using the Toolbar
When a comment is selected, a floating toolbar appears above or below it with options to:
- **Edit**: Enter edit mode (or double-click the comment)
- **Delete**: Remove the comment
- **Color Settings**: Customize fill, border, and text colors
- **Line Style**: Adjust border style (solid, dashed, dotted, long-dash)
- **Line Thickness**: Set border thickness (1-8px)

## Linking Comments to Concepts

Comments can be linked to one or more concepts to provide contextual annotations:

1. **Select a comment** node
2. **Drag a connection handle** from the comment to a concept
3. The comment is now linked to that concept

You can link a single comment to multiple concepts by dragging additional connections.

## Comment Properties

Each comment has:
- **Text**: Markdown-formatted content
- **Position**: X and Y coordinates on the canvas
- **Creator**: The user who created the comment (shown as avatar on hover)
- **Linked Concepts**: Concepts this comment is associated with
- **Created/Updated Timestamps**: Automatic tracking

## Visual Design

Comments appear as yellow sticky notes with:
- **Curled corner effect** for a realistic sticky note appearance
- **Connection handles** at the top and bottom for linking to concepts
- **Creator avatar** displayed on hover
- **Customizable colors** via the toolbar

## Permissions

- **Read Access**: Users with read-only access can view comments but cannot edit or delete them
- **Write Access**: Users with write access can create, edit, and delete comments
- Comments respect the same permission model as concepts and relationships

## Deleting Comments

- **Select a comment** and press `Delete` or `Backspace`
- Or use the **Delete button** in the comment toolbar
- Comments are soft-deleted (preserved in history)

## Use Cases

Comments are useful for:
- **Explanatory notes**: Add context or explanations to complex concepts
- **Questions**: Mark areas that need clarification
- **Collaboration**: Leave notes for team members
- **Documentation**: Provide additional details without cluttering concept labels
- **Annotations**: Link multiple concepts with shared commentary
