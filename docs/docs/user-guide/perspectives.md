# Perspectives

Perspectives allow you to create filtered views of your concept map, focusing on specific subsets of concepts and relationships.

## What Are Perspectives?

A perspective is a named subset of a concept map that includes:

- Selected concepts
- Selected relationships
- A custom name

Perspectives are useful for:
- Focusing on specific topics
- Creating presentations
- Analyzing subsets of large maps
- Temporary views while editing

## Creating a Perspective

1. In the sidebar, expand the map you want to create a perspective for
2. Click **"Add Perspective"** at the bottom of the perspectives list
3. Enter a name for the perspective
4. Click **"Create"**

The perspective will be created empty and appear in the sidebar. You can then edit it to add concepts and relationships.

## Viewing a Perspective

1. In the sidebar, click on a perspective name
2. The canvas will filter to show only concepts and relationships included in that perspective
3. Concepts and relationships not in the perspective are hidden

## Editing Perspectives

To edit which concepts and relationships are included in a perspective:

1. **Select a perspective** from the sidebar (to view it)
2. Click the **"Edit Perspective"** button in the toolbar
3. A side panel will open showing all concepts and relationships in the map
4. **Toggle inclusion** using:
   - **Checkboxes** in the side panel for concepts and relationships
   - **Shift+Click** on concepts in the canvas to toggle them
5. Concepts and relationships not included are shown greyed out
6. Changes are saved automatically

**Note:** Relationships can only be included if both their source and target concepts are already in the perspective.

## Perspective Editor Modes

The perspective editor has two modes:

- **Edit Mode**: Shows all concepts and relationships (greyed out if not included)
- **View Mode**: Shows only included concepts and relationships (read-only)

Toggle between modes using the Eye/Edit icon button in the editor panel header.

## Deleting Perspectives

1. Open the perspective editor (click "Edit Perspective" button)
2. Click the **"Delete Perspective"** button at the bottom of the editor panel
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleting a perspective does not delete the underlying concepts or relationships - it only removes the filtered view.
