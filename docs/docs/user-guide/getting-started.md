# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the Concept Mapping Tool.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- An InstantDB account (free tier available)

## Creating Your First Map

1. **Sign Up or Log In**
   - Click the "Sign Up" button if you're new
   - Or log in with your existing account

2. **Create a New Map**
   - Click "New Map" in the sidebar
   - Give your map a name
   - Click "Create"

3. **Add Your First Concept**
   - Double-click on the canvas to create a concept
   - Type the concept name
   - Press Enter to confirm

4. **Create Relationships**

   **Method 1: Option/Alt-Drag (Easiest)**
   - Hold **Option** (Mac) or **Alt** (Windows/Linux) and hover over a concept
   - The handle expands to cover the entire node
   - Drag from anywhere on the node to another concept
   - Enter the relationship label and press Enter

   **Method 2: Drag from Center Handle**
   - Click and drag from the small center handle on a concept
   - Enter the relationship label
   - Press Enter to confirm

   **Method 3: Triple Entry (Fast Keyboard Method)**
   - Double-click on a concept node to edit its label
   - Type: `"Concept1 verb phrase Concept2"` (e.g., `"Diagrams explain Architecture"`)
   - Press Enter
   - The system creates the relationship and new concept automatically
   - The new concept enters edit mode so you can continue typing more triples!

5. **Add Comments (Optional)**
   - Right-click on the canvas and select "Add Comment"
   - Double-click the comment to edit its text
   - Drag connection handles to link comments to concepts

6. **Customize Appearance**
   - Select any node or edge to see the floating toolbar
   - Use the toolbar to customize colors, styles, and line thickness
   - Changes are saved automatically

## View Modes

The tool supports multiple view modes:

- **Graph View**: Visual node-and-edge representation (default)
- **Text View**: Structured text representation with triple notation (appears as a draggable node on the canvas)
- **Both**: Show graph and text view simultaneously

Toggle the text view using the **FileText** button in the React Flow controls (bottom-left of the canvas). The text view appears as a draggable node that you can position anywhere on the canvas.
